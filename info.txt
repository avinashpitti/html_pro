why should we use html?
we should use html because it is the foundation of the web.
without html, webpages literally can't exist.
browsers can't understand plain text on their own
By tags they can understand it is a heading, it is a paragraph etc.
html gives meaning + structure


what is hypertext?
The text that contains links to other text/resources.

what is markup language?
A way to mark content using tags to describe its meaning
markup describes <h1> it is a heading
markup describes <p> it is a paragraph
html just describes, it doesn't have any logic like backend languages
that's why we call it as a markup language

<ol> attributes:
type="A" or "a" or "1" or "i(roman)" etc

<ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li value="5">CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
</ol> # output 1.html 5.css 6.JavaScript

ul attributes are deprecated



forms in html?
forms take data from the user in the form of input
Backend receives data in the form : name =value
The name attribute is the key sent to the backend
ex:
<input type="text" name="email" value="avinash@gmail.com">
Backend receives
email=avinash@gmail.com

ex:
<select name="gender">
    <option value="male">Male</option>
    <option value="female">Female</option>
</select>
when user selects female,backend receives
gender='female'
